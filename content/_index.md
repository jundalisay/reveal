<p style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; text-align: left; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
A <b>points-based economic system</b>, as delayed barter, designed to solve the problems with the money system such as inflation, poverty, inequality, unemployment, stagnation, financial crises, debt crises, trade wars, etc.

<h4 style="color: crimson; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .8;">What are the Problems with the Money system?</h4>

<small style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; text-align: left; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

Money can be <b>hoarded</b>. This stops the economy from circulating

You need to <b>guard</b> the money -- this <b>raises the cost</b> and creates the risk of theft, armed robbery, phishing, scams, etc.

You need to <b>wait</b> for the money payments. Delays can halt production

People <b>chase money</b> instead of chasing skills and productivity. This leads to <b>people talking instead of doing</b>.

<h4 style="color: crimson; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .8;">The Problems with Money Naturally Lead to Crises</h4>

<small style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
Paper money and stock certificates were invented in the 17th century in Britain and France, by learning from the Italians and Jews. 

This gave Europe the capital to launch colonization via Royal Companies.

Afterwards, credit crises and large wars became frequent.

- 1772 Credit Crunch and 1779 American Revolution
- 19th century Napoleonic Wars
- 1915-1945 World War I and II
- 1954-1991 Cold War
- 2008 Financial Crisis
- 2020 Stagflation and Ukraine War

<h4 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .9;">Crises Can be Predicted</h4>

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
The Pattern of Money and Crises helped us create a model that predicted <b>a global stagflation starting from 2019</b>, eventually leading to war. 

Governments will not be able to solve it because all governments are money-minded (*mukhang pera*).

"The Maharlikan traders assemble in crowds and carry the goods away with them in baskets. Even if the foreign merchants do not know the Maharlikan traders, <b>there will be no loss</b>. 

The native traders will bring those goods to other islands for barter. It will take <b>8-9 months for them to return</b>. They then repay the foreign merchants with what they had obtained for the goods. 

Some, however, do not return within the proper time. This delay is why vessels trading with Maharlika are the last to return home."

<p style="background-color: black; color: white; opacity: .9; padding: 15px">Delayed Barter uses <b>records</b> to prove the claims of traders. Immediate barter does not use records.</p>

<small style="background-color: black; color: white; opacity: .9; padding: 15px">

- The Inca used **knots on strings**
- Maharlika used **leaf-notes and copperplates**
- Pantrypoints uses **databases** ('Web2' for national commerce) and will use **private blockchain** ('Web3' for international commerce)

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .9; padding: 15px">Delayed Barter is a Debt System in Kind</h5>

<small style="text-align: left; color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .9; padding: 15px">
An example of delayed barter is the family economy. 

The parents spend for their children who are expected to bring home good grades in return, and be productive in the future.

Parents never 'monetize' their children. Instead, they ask their children to do chores in exchange. **Friends and family never objectify value**. Instead, they let value flow naturally for **mutual benefit**.

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

Software developers are expensive because they have to go through a 4-year course. 

We will train our own software developers from high school level using the Bootcamp model, with help from:
- University of Perpetual Help (Las Pinas)
- San Francisco High School (Quezon City)

This will make websites, apps, IoT, blockchain, and data science **cheap** so that more Micro-Small Businesses can use them.

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 10px">Points Mechanism:<br> 1 Point = Price of 1 kg rice</h5>

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
Delayed barter uses points pegged to the retail price of basic rice (NFA) which is linear and predictable. 


- 2003 - 21 pesos
- 2010 - 27 pesos
- 2018 - 32 pesos
- 2020 - 35 pesos
- 2022 - 38 pesos


This will create stability in the economy, different from the current volatile pricing of stocks and oil.

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 10px;">Expansion to World Trade</h5>

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">

The points system expands to world trade via [Pool Clearing](https://www.pool.pantrypoints.com), where national rice price is the basis of currency.

For example, the "pool exchange rates" between Vietnam and the Philippines is below

Year | Current System | Pantrypoints Pool System
--- | --- | --- 
2010 | 1 USD = 40 PHP = 19,000 VND | 1 USD = 27 PHP = 8,000 VND 
2022 | 1 USD = 58 PHP = 24,000 VND | 1 USD = 38 PHP = 12,000 VND 
Difference | 18 Pesos, 5000 VND | **11 Pesos, 4000 VND**
<!-- Range | 45% Philippines, 26% Vietnam  | 41% Philippines, 50% Vietnam -->

<!-- ## Planned Overseas Expansion

- **Vietnam**: We started testing our system in Vietnam in 2016. This is our solution to the invasion of saltwater and other problems in the Mekong
- **Spain**: There is a Filipino community in the Basque region that is interested in our moneyless system.  -->

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
The system will earn by points taxation in kind which will then be sold for cash in the Pantrypoints shop.

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 10px;">Example</h5>

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
A farmer grows 10 kilos of tomatoes per harvest by using our system. At 5% points-tax, he should give us 500 grams or 5 large tomatoes. 

We will then sell it for cash to remit to government (as modern 'tax farmers') and to our creditors.

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 10px;">Points-Banking</h5>

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
Points are bilateral. To diversity one's revenue, a user might want to transfer his points balance to a third person. This transfer must be approved by a bank to make sure that it is backed by real productivity. The bank then earns a few points for facilitating the transfer.

This will be a new business of banks.

<!-- ## Adding Points-Banking to Money-Banking 

Banks can add a new business: **points-banking**.

Their job will be to **verify** the productivity of the users, and the reality of the points. 

They earn by getting a cut of the points-taxation.

<small>We create a circular economy based on bicycles and manual labor in order to mitigate the effects of high oil and energy prices.</small>

<!-- <h4 style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .8; padding: 10px;">Implementation: Village Contract Farming</h4> -->

<small>Step 5: We use the small cash flow to get a bigger loan to implement the system in larger farms outside of the city to eventually sell for export.</small>

<h4 style="">Results: 23% Success Rate</h4>

<small>

We seeded 6 plots in various areas with volunteer growers. Only 3 plots produced crops leading to a 23% success rate (105 sqm out of 465 sqm). The larger the plot, the greater the chance of failure. Thus, our focus is to increase the number of plots.

<!-- due to neglect, labor requirements, and other factors -->

</small>

<h4 style="">Funding Needs: Php 100,000 Peso grant</h4>


<small>
To increase the success rate, we plan to give rice as incentive to the volunteer growers, as consumables of 1 kilo per hour of labor
