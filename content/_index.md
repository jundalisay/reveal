<h4 style="color: crimson; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .8;">What are the Problems with the Money system?</h4>

<small style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; text-align: left; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

Money can be <b>hoarded</b>. This stops the economy from circulating

You need to <b>guard</b> the money -- this <b>raises the cost</b> and creates the risk of theft, armed robbery, phishing, scams, etc.

You need to <b>wait</b> for the money payments. Delays can halt production

People <b>chase money</b> instead of chasing skills and productivity

#### The Problems with Money Naturally Create Crises

<small style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
Paper money and stock certificates were invented in the 17th century in Britain and France, by learning from the Italians and Jews. 

This gave Europe the capital to launch colonization via Royal Companies.

Afterwards, credit crises and large wars became frequent.

- 1772 Credit Crunch and 1779 American Revolution
- 19th century Napoleonic Wars
- 1915-1945 World War I and II
- 1954-1991 Cold War
- 2008 Financial Crisis
- 2020 Stagflation and Ukraine War

<h4 style="color: white;">Crises Can be Predicted</h4>


<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .7; padding: 15px;">
The Pattern of Money and Crises helped us create a model that predicted a global stagflation starting from 2019, eventually leading to war. 

Governments will not be able to solve it because all governments are money-minded (*mukhang pera*).

<h4 style="color: white; background-color: #2b2e19;">The ancient solution was delayed-barter</h4>

<small style="color: white; background-color: #2b2e19;">The Inca avoided crises by using strings, as knots, to record the value of the work done by the citizens. It would pay them with food from the granary.</small>

<small style="color: white; background-color: #2b2e19;">This system created economic order and reduced war.</small>

<small style="color: white; background-color: #2b2e19;">Instead of knots, we use <b>points</b>.</small>

<small style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; color: white; background-color: #004b98;">
The Maharlikan traders assemble in crowds and carry the goods away with them in baskets. Even if the foreign merchants do not know the Maharlikan traders, <b>there will be no loss</b>. 

The native traders will bring those goods to other islands for barter. It will take <b>8-9 months for them to return</b>. They then repay the foreign merchants with what they had obtained for the goods. 

Some, however, do not return within the proper time. This delay is why vessels trading with Maharlika are the last to return home.

<h5 style="background-color: #b4875d; opacity: .9;">What is Delayed Barter?</h5>

<p style="background-color: #b4875d; opacity: .9;">Delayed Barter uses <b>records</b> to prove the claims of traders. Immediate barter does not use records.</p>

<small style="background-color: #b4875d; opacity: .9;">

- The Inca used **knots on strings**
- Maharlika used **leaf-notes and copperplates**
- Pantrypoints uses **databases** ('Web2' for national commerce) and will use **private blockchain** ('Web3' for international commerce)

<h5 style="color: white; background-color: #004b98; opacity: .8;">Delayed Barter is a Debt System in Kind</h5>

<small style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; color: white; background-color: #004b98;">
An example of delayed barter is the family economy. 

The parents spend for their children who are expected to bring home good grades in return, and be productive in the future.

Parents never 'monetize' their children. Instead, they ask their children to do chores in exchange. **Friends and family never objectify value**. Instead, they let value flow naturally for **mutual benefit**.

<!-- Raises the Morality Level -->

<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; color: white; background-color: #004b98; opacity: .8;">Emotional Quotient (EQ) is seen in the Marshmallow test where children chose to get their rewards later. Such children became successful in life.</p>

<small style="color: white; background-color: #083e0e; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

- Local Government provides seeds and fertilizer to urban farmer
- They write the valuation in "point-cards"
- Urban farmer gives part of the harvest to the Local Government according to the point-cards

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">
These are bilateral 'blank checks' between 2 parties in a trade. The truth of the value in these cards are verified by Points-banking.

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">How it Works for Services (Online Mode)</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

- A web developer makes a website for a small restaurant
- The restaurant pays the web developer in meals to the value of the website, measured in points, through the Pantrypoints app

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">The Pantrypoints App</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

The App does the work of Points cards and lets users transact points with each other. It also makes points-banking easier.

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">Pantrypoints will Power the Digital Transformation of Micro-Small Businesses</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

Software developers are expensive because they have to go through a 4-year course. 

We will train our own software developers from high school level using the Bootcamp model, with help from University of Perpetual Help (Las Pinas) and San Francisco High School (Quezon City)

This will make websites, apps, IoT, blockchain, and data science **cheap** so that more Micro-Small Businesses can use them.

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">Points Mechanism</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">


#### 1 Point = Price of 1 kg rice

Delayed barter uses points pegged to the retail price of basic rice (NFA) which is linear and predictable. 

- 2003 - 21 pesos
- 2010 - 27 pesos
- 2018 - 32 pesos
- 2020 - 35 pesos
- 2022 - 38 pesos


This will create stability in the economy, different from the current volatile pricing of stocks and oil.

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">Expansion to World Trade</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
The points system expands to world trade via Pool Clearing, where national rice price is the basis of currency.

For example, the "pool exchange rates" between Vietnam and the Philippines is below

Year | Current System | Pantrypoints Pool System
--- | --- | --- 
2010 | 1 USD = 40 PHP = 19,000 VND | 1 USD = 27 PHP = 8,000 VND 
2022 | 1 USD = 58 PHP = 24,000 VND | 1 USD = 38 PHP = 12,000 VND 
Difference | 18 Pesos, 5000 VND | **11 Pesos, 4000 VND**
<!-- Range | 45% Philippines, 26% Vietnam  | 41% Philippines, 50% Vietnam -->

## Planned Overseas Expansion

- **Vietnam**: We started testing our system in Vietnam in 2016. This is our solution to the invasion of saltwater and other problems in the Mekong
- **Spain**: There is a Filipino community in the Basque region that is interested in our moneyless system.

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">Revenue Model: Points Taxation</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
The system will earn by points taxation in kind which will then be sold for cash in the Pantrypoints shop. 
</small>

<!-- , similar to a government or transaction fees like Grab and Uber.  -->
<!-- Users who do not pay will have their access suspended. -->

<h5 style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8;">Example</h5>

<small style="color: black; background-color: white; opacity: .8; padding: 15px">
A farmer grows 10 kilos of tomatoes per harvest by using our system. At 5% points-tax, he should give us 500 grams or 5 large tomatoes. 

We will then sell it for cash to remit to government (as modern 'tax farmers').  
</small>

{{< slide background-image="/pointtax.jpg" >}}

## Penalty for Non-payment

Users who do not pay will have their access suspended. 

They will then have to find money to buy their seeds and fertilizers at expensive 'commercial rates'. 

If they deal with services, then they must work for money (get a job) instead of being free entrepreneurs.

## Points-Banking

Points-banking is the transfer of points from one user to another, done by the bank.

## Adding Points-Banking to Money-Banking 

Banks can add a new business: **points-banking**.

Their job will be to **verify** the productivity of the users, and the reality of the points. 

They earn by getting a cut of the points-taxation.
