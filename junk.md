## A System Not Based on Selfish-Interest

Pantrypoints is not a business. It is a **system of government** that manifests as an economic system. 

It is based on Maharlikan fellow-feeling (malasakit, pakikipagkapwa) instead of European selfish-interest.

## A System Built for AI

Pantrypoints is built from the ground up to be run by artificial intelligence (AI). 

The AI can overcome the weaknesses of human nature (greed, limited data processing, non-24 hour operation, etc). AI will help ensure that the system will not degrade into money and selfishness.

## Economy-as-a-Service (EaaS)


The AI can deploy the economic system as Economy-as-a-Service (EaaS) whenever money-based economic systems collapse or suffer inflation and unemployment.
